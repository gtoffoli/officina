# officina
A simple publisher catalog in Django

This Django app is a port of a Plone product developed to manage the catalog of Officina Editore, a small specialized book publisher.

The Plone product was a customization of a much more complex application supporting digital document repositories.

This first version of the  the officina app focuses on the definition of a minimum data model allowing data migration.

Next, we plan to implement the front-office user interface and to integrate officina with django-shop, to add simple e-commerce functionality.
